# Tello_Drone_Controller_PyQt5
Developing an App for issuing commands to a Tello Drone incorporating standard tello functions and Open CV functionality. 

The app is intended to be the central hub for issuing autonomous drone commands using the tello and open cv libraries as the basis of the decision making and flight control framework. The app will also provide visualizations of the flight patterns and areas covered.
